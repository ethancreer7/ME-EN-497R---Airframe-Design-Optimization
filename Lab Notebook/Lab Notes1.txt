- Consider comparing convergence values against databases
- Richardson Extrapolation, look into it. This will make it so that you don't have to run so many simulations.

- Neural network training... testing vs training sets

Richardson Extrapolation




11/11/2025 - Stability Meeting
vpm_viscous = vpm.CoreSpreading(mu/rho, sigma_vpm_overwrite, vpm.kernel_gaussianerf)
vpm_SFS = vpm.SFS_Cd_twolevel_nobackscatter

    Adding pylock around the generate_rotor call which will hopefully help with multi threading

    Next Steps:
    - run n convergence
    - Re run nsteps_per rev with multi threading to compare outputs with pre stabilization in final file
    - Tinker around with p_per_step
    - Verification
    - Report

    Log of what we've done today - 
    - Lots (and lots) of debugging segmentation faults and type errors
    - Got the script to run with no segmentation faults!
    - Final debugging to get all xmf files to output. Only getting the first and last time steps for some reason
    - Running n convergence overnight, using nsteps_per_rev_converged = 120
    - Mach reached 1.27 on inviscid model. Failed on n20 at time step 80. Mach reached 1.17 on viscous model. Failed on n20 at time step 80 as well.
    - Overnight mach reached 2.9 on viscid model. Again n20 time step 80.

 - Examined ParaView Files for mach 2.9 case. Revealed that particles blew up near the hub rather than the tip. Also initial sheds were a little large
 - Accounting for both by running hubtiploss_correction = hubtiploss_correction_prandtl as a parameter.
 - Currently running nsteps_per_rev to get potentially a better convergence value. Could perhaps help with stability in the n sweep.
    - That ran about 30 minutes. So you could say multi threading makes a difference

11/14/2025
 - Found an experimental database for the propeller in use for this study. See experimental_prop_data.txt in Project 6
 - The closest simulation parameters in this dataset are 9000 RPM and J = 0.3934 (to our 9200 RPM and J = 0.4). This gives a CT values of 0.0900, very close to what our Richardson Extrapolation gave of 0.087.
 Especially considering increasing J, lowers the CT value, and our simulation parameters are slightly different.


 11/14/2025
 - Ran an nsteps_per_rev_convergence study on wide range -- [20, 40, 80, 160, 320] -- Ran on 32 cores, 16 RAM in 1 hour 5 minutes - Note that 71% of RAM was used and only 39% of cores were used
 - CT_inf came out to be 0.08717687674035962
    - nsteps = 320 gave CT = 0.08629435954390076 with an error of approximately 1.01%
    - nsteps = 160 gave CT = 0.08549578869647932 with an error of approximately 1.93%
    - To obtain a roughly 1.5% convergence, we will move forward with nsteps = 240 (halfway between the two) for future reference


11/17/2025
 - Still struggling with segfaults and mach issues. Relaxing some parameters to see if anything changes. Reviewing source code for any other potential parameters that could be changed.
 - Going to try looping through n = 25 instead - it seems n = 10 and n = 20 produce final CT vals within approximately 1 % of each other, which is probably good enough.
 - Also going to adjust shed_starting to be true and see its affect on the simulation. Changed max p_per_step to 5 Filed as ntest directory.
 - It Worked!! shed_starting = true, p_per_step_max = 5, rotor_surf = R/15, r = 1/3.


 11/19/2025
 - Used SLURM arrays, and now it works perfectly!!!!! Even for much greater values of n. Going to submit a verification test, to see what happens.

Lab Meeting:
- 3D Panel Method





12/1/2025
- Currently re-running some finer n values to see if I can get a better richardson convergence compared to the jank 4 dot cluster one.
- These runs are under ntest 48 +
- I reran ntest55 with the spline_s = 0.02 to see if it deviates significantly from spline_s = 0.01 on the normal ntest55 run
- Use this information in conjunction with the test_for_richardson.jl and richardson_percent_error_stats.jl scripts to find statistics and richardson extrapolation. Probably only use n = 40 and up. Ignore what's below that.
- Made significant progress on report. nsteps_per_rev is done. Discussed software debugging present in n convergence study.
- Still working on debugging and finetuning convergence study. Potentially will need re-run of verification.
- In terms of wake convergence, the wake is pretty much converged as evidenced by the wake plots that are made in teh wake_convergence folder and FDOM Figures folder.
- Visualize in paraview for more info, but other than that next steps below.

NEXT STEPS:
- Finalize n convergence. This may take a few hours or so
- Write n convergence section of report
- Discuss p_per_step
- Add Verification Section? Before p_per_step section?
- Begin working on final presentation.
- Good work, and lots more to come.
